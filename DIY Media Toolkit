# DIY MEDIA TOOLKIT

It's like this: The gear needed to make high quality, professional media yourself has never been more affordable or accessible. If you want to report the news, make a film, record an album, or create a podcast, the tools required are available for less than you might suspect.

Here we're running down a quick list of our top suggestions for affordable and useful hardware and software for media creators, along with some tips on how to use each item. This is not meant to represent the top of the line, but rather to serve as a reference for good, cheap, and occasionally creative solutions.

*Note: while we usually recommend (and use!) Free and Open Source software wherever possible, Media Production often benefits from the use of proprietary software. Making new things, as quickly and simply as possible is our primary goal, and we will use (and recommend) software that we disagree with ideologically when they are the best options for meeting larger goals.*

## Video (films/tv shows/vlogs)



## Photos

Honestly, the old addage is true. The best camera is the one you have with you. If you have an iPhone, or a reasonably recent Android phone, it probably has a good enough camera on it for 75 - 80 % of what you need. For those occasions when a Phone Camera doesn't cut it, here are some suggestions for alternatives.

### Good and Cheap
These are standard issue digital cameras that take photos that are better than most cell phones (though, to be fair, the iPhone comes damn close.)


### High Optical Zoom

There are a few benefits to getting one of these cameras, with an integrated optical zoom. First, they take much larger pictures than most smartphones, with better colors, sharper details. Second, 20x optical zoom is nothing to laugh at. If deployed correctly, that optical zoom can make a world of difference to an image. The third benefit to this style of camera is a little more dubious: The Appearence of Professionalism. These cameras tend to look close enough to higher end cameras that the casual observer can't tell the difference. It's easier to bluff your way in to the press pool with something that looks like a pro would use it.

### Good Low Light

Low light performance is super important in a lot of situations. Here are a few cameras that provide better low light performance than your standard smartphone (and one tip for improving that even more)

- IR photography + an infrared flashlight

### Professional Quality

DSLRs and Micro 4/3 cameras tend to be expensive and complicated. If you're a pro photographer, go for it! If not, this may be more trouble than its worth.

- Using Vintage Glass
- Cheapest Bodies
- Buying used DSLRs

### Film

There is still something to be said for Analog Photography. While we don't recommend making a film camera the only camera you take on a shoot, knowing your way around an old school SLR, point-and-shoot, or Polaroid is a valuable skill.

- Picking a vintage SLR
- Instant Film (Fujifilm vs Impossible)
- Getting film developed
  - Developing your own
- Why Bother?

## Text

### Software

**Windows**

**Mac**

**Linux**

**Collaborating**
There are a few ways to collaborate on a text based project. Each has it's own hurdles, as discussed below 

- git
	- git (and github and prose.io) serve as a great platform for version control and collaborative writing. 
	- Open Source
	- Generally easy to use
	- Ethical 
- google docs
	- Google Docs works well for real time collaboration 
	- provides rudimentary version control 
	- It's convenient, and generally intuitive (as long as you don't mind that Big Brother is watching.) 
- dropbox
	- Work in whatever program you want, and sync files with dropbox 
	- Great for collaborating on all kinds of files, not just text 
	- No version control 
	- The NSA is probably watching, since [Condoleezza Rice is on their board of directors](http://boingboing.net/2014/04/09/condoleeza-rice-supporter-of.html) 
- sneakernet 
	- Trading files on physical media is the old school way to collaborate 
	- It's not the fastest or easiest method, but it's probably the most secure

### Hardware

**laptop/tablet**

 - Cheap Options:  
	 - Kindle Fire + Bluetooth Keyboard
	 - Acer Ideabook
	 - Chromebook
	 - Use what you already have 

**Keyboard**

Here are guides for doing just that, along with some suggested hardware, and some tricks to keep your prices low. In each case, we'll highlight DIY and Third Party methods, including a breakdown of the differences in cost and quality.
