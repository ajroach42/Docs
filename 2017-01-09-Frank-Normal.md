They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. I don't know much for men, but if you try to get to a vampire's heart through his stomach... well, that's going to end pretty poorly for you. The way to a vampire's heart is through his chest with a wooden stake, if you catch my meaning. By the time I was through, I'd found the hearts of five or six of them suckers, no stomachs required. Seems the only thing I couldn't find was my client, so's that I could get paid. Ain't that how they all go? I knew I should have insisted on that retainer. 

The name's Normal. Frank Normal, Occult detective. I solve the crimes that the other detectives are too scared, too smart, or too boring to touch. Hell, I'll do just about anything for $29 a day plus expenses. I been in this buisness a lotta years, and with my reputation, and all the wackadoo witchcraft Washington attracts, you'd think I'd have it pretty swell. Thin is, you'd be wrong. 

Besides, if I had things so swell, there'd be no story. And brother is there ever a story. This one starts, as most of the great ones do, with a dame.

It was a quarter to five on a cold evening in late January, there was half an inch of ice covering everything, and I could see the sun starting to set through the lone window of the barely-not-condemned office that I refered to optimistically as the world headquarters of Normal Occult Investigations. I hadn't seen a client, or more importantly, a fee, in two weeks. The only thing keeping the lights on was the fact that the roads were too trecherous for anyone to come by and cut the power. I'm not even really sure what I was doing in the office, other than throwing back enough dark roast to give me heartburn for two weeks and foolishly hoping that I'd find a miracle client. 

I didn't. Instead I found a dame. The dame knocked on the door, which was odd. Folks don't normally knock, but I didn't think much of it. It was icey out, and not many places were open. I was relieved enough to have someone at the door, I didn't give it much thought as I opened it. 

"Come in, come in Ms..." 

"Harker. Call me Minnie" she said in a voice that reaked of quiet authority. 

"Minnie it is then. Please, have a seat." I said, gesturing to a green leather sofa opposite my desk, and feeling for all the world like the most inaddiquit man that has ever lived. She was a looker, 5' 7", slim, pale, dressed to the nines. 

She sat down, and looked at me expectantly. I realized I was staring. 

"Can I offer you some coffee Ms. Harker" 

"Call me Minnie" she repeted, and I felt like a dolt. 

"Minnie, then. Can I offer you some coffee Minnie?" 

"Oh, I never drink" she said, and paused for a beat to long before adding "Coffee, that is. I never drink Coffee." 

If I had been thinking straight, I would have sent her out the door right that second. Throwing me an old softball like that. Hell, it was practically Lugossi. A pale woman with a white parasol, dressed head to toe in black--Her name was Minnie Harker for chrissake--stood in my office and practically quotes The Count himself, and I didn't notice. But she was beautiful, and I needed a client. 

"What can I do for you Minnie?" I asked, with an earnestness I'm seldom found wearing. 

"Well, Mr. Normal" she began "I'm afraid I'm in a bit of trouble, and I need some help. 

"What kind of trouble Minnie?" Again, I was so earnest. So eager. It almost makes me want to wretch. 

"I guess I better start at the beginning Mr. Normal." she said, launching in to her tale. I won't bore you with the steamy details, mostly because I'm embarassed that I believed them, but the end result was a contract stipulating that I would investigate her two brothers, Drake and Johnathan, and in return she would pay me $29 dollars a day, plus expenses. 

It seemed like a swell deal at the time. 

I stayed in the office for another few minutes after she left, sucking on a bottle of scotch and trying to shake the sense that I had just gotten myself in the middle of something bad. She'd been out the door five whole minutes before I pieced together she was a vampire, but by then it was already too late.
