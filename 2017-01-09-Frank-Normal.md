They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. I don't know much for men, but if you try to get to a vampire's heart through his stomach... well, that's going to end pretty poorly for you. The way to a vampire's heart is through his chest with a wooden stake, if you catch my meaning. By the time I was through, I'd found the hearts of five or six of them suckers, no stomachs required. Seems the only thing I couldn't find was my client, so's that I could get paid. Ain't that how they all go? I knew I should have insisted on that retainer. 

The name's Normal. Frank Normal, Occult detective. I solve the crimes that the other detectives are too scared, too smart, or too boring to touch. Hell, I'll do just about anything for $29 a day plus expenses. I been in this buisness a lotta years, and with my reputation, and all the wackadoo witchcraft Washington attracts, you'd think I'd have it pretty swell. Thing is, you'd be wrong. 

Besides, if I had things so swell, there'd be no story. And brother is there ever a story. This one starts, as most of the great ones do, with a dame.

It was a quarter to five on a cold evening in late January, there was half an inch of ice covering everything, and I could see the sun starting to set through the lone window of the barely-not-condemned office that I refered to optimistically as the world headquarters of Normal Occult Investigations. I hadn't seen a client, or more importantly, a fee, in two weeks. The only thing keeping the lights on was the fact that the roads were too trecherous for anyone to come by and cut the power. I'm not even really sure what I was doing in the office, other than throwing back enough dark roast to give me heartburn for two weeks and foolishly hoping that I'd find a miracle client. 

I didn't. Instead I found a dame. The dame knocked on the door, which was odd. Folks don't normally knock, but I didn't think much of it. It was icey out, and not many places were open. I was relieved enough to have someone at the door, I didn't give it much thought as I opened it. 

"Come in, come in Ms..." 

"Harker. Call me Minnie" she said in a voice that reaked of quiet authority. 

"Minnie it is then. Please, have a seat." I said, gesturing to a green leather sofa opposite my desk, and feeling for all the world like the most inaddiquit man that has ever lived. She was a looker, 5' 7", slim, pale, big red lips, dressed to the nines. 

She sat down, and looked at me expectantly. I realized I was staring. 

"Can I offer you some coffee Ms. Harker" 

"Call me Minnie" she repeted, and I felt like a dolt. 

"Minnie, then. Can I offer you some coffee Minnie?" 

"Oh, I never drink" she said, and paused for a beat too long before adding "Coffee, that is. I never drink Coffee." 

If I had been thinking straight, I would have sent her out the door right that second. Throwing me an old softball like that. Hell, it was practically Lugossi. A pale woman with a white parasol, dressed head to toe in black--Her name was Minnie Harker for chrissake--stood in my office, damn near quotes The Count himself, and I didn't notice. 

In my defense, she was beautiful, and I needed a client. 

"What can I do for you Minnie?" I asked, with an earnestness I'm seldom found wearing. 

"Well, Mr. Normal" she began "I'm afraid I'm in a bit of trouble, and I need some help. 

"What kind of trouble Minnie?" Again, I was so earnest. So eager. It almost makes me want to wretch. 

"I guess I better start at the beginning Mr. Normal." she said, launching in to her tale. I won't bore you with the steamy details, mostly because I'm embarassed that I believed them, but the end result was a contract stipulating that I would investigate her two brothers, Drake and Johnathan, and in return she would pay me $29 dollars a day, plus expenses. 

It seemed like a swell deal at the time. 

I stayed in the office for another few minutes after she left, sucking on a bottle of scotch and trying to shake the sense that I had just gotten myself in the middle of something bad. She'd been out the door five whole minutes before I pieced together she was a vampire, but by then it was already too late.

I stood up, poured the rest of the office scotch and the remains of the office coffee in to a mug, grabbed my coat, my beretta, and my hat, and made for the door. There was a storm blowing in, the sun had already set (and it wasn't even half past five), and I'd just agreed to tail two probable vampires for another probable vampire. I was in for a long night. 

The thing about being an Occult Detective is that you have a tendency to piss off, well, everyone. Over the years, I've brawled with more than any man's fair share of Werewolfs, Deathcults, Demons, Angels, and a rogue God or two. Hell, it's barely been a year since I was in a spitting match with ol' Lucifer himself. And, to be clear, that's not a game I want to play again any time soon, it would have almost been preferable to what came next. 

I don't normally dance with Vampires. In all my years as an Occult Investigator, I'd managed to stay, more or less, off their radar. That was by design. See, most vampires take the whole "brotherhood" thing pretty seriously. You piss one of them off, and next thing you know his six buddies have mesmerised you in to performing a political assassination and jumping off a bridge. 

I was not looking forward to this case. 

I took a swing from my mug, and left it on top of the filing cabinet by the door. As the burn subsided I made a mental note to pad my expense report a little more than normal, and stepped out the front door and in to the cold winter air. 

-------

>Hiya, folks around these parts call me Ruby. Folks 'round your parts would probably just call me "AHHH! LOOK! WHAT IS THAT THING!", or "BE GONE FOUL CREATURE OF THE NIGHT" but I'll try not to take it personally. I'm what you would call a creature of unspeakable terror. You know the type I mean, all tenticles and teeth. I run a little speakeasy that caters to occult types a few blocks from Frank's office. 

>Frank stops in most nights on his way home from the office. I've never understood that, because I know he pulls from his office bottle at least once an hour, but he never causes any trouble and he's helped me out a time or two, so I don't ask too many questions. When he came by that night, well, that night things was different. Frank kept alternating between lookin' like he was in a trance and lookin like he was terrified. I couldn't help but check in on him. 

>When he saw me, he screamed. This was pretty normal. I let him get it out of his system. Eventually, he stopped and said "Ruby, I think I'm in trouble" more sheepishly than I can ever remember him speaking. I slid over to the piano in the corner of the room and asked Howie to take over at the bar, then I told Frank to join me in the back where we could talk.

>It took a lot to shake up Frank, so when we had found a little bit of privacy, I decided to get some answers. 

>"What's goin on Frankie?" I said, trying to sound concerned. 

>"Ruby... I got a new client tonight" 

>"Well that's great news Frank, why do you look like someone shot your dog?" 

>"Ruby..." He said, his mouth hanging open like he was trying to force words through it. Eventually, he managed to continue "What do you know about Minnie Harker?" 

> The name hit me like a punch to the gut. Well, that's not fair, since a punch to the gut wouldn't be possible or effective against me, as I'm a massive creature of unimaginable horror. The name hit me like a punch to the gut would hit you, or another soft squishy human. My vision blurred. 

>"I feel like I hit a nerve, there" Frank said, with a wince. I must have been emmitting a low level field of emotional pain. It happens sometimes when I'm caught off guard. 

>"Frank, Minnie was a dear friend of mine. Her death was tragic, but there was nothing mysterious about it." 

>Frank winced again, but this time it was under his own power. He looked at me with disbelief in his eyes. With more disbelief in his eyes than is normally found in the eyes of someone staring at a barkeep of unimaginable ancient horror. 

>"Ruby, I think I better start at the beginning" Frank finally said. 

>He told me about seeing "The Dame". He told me about his money troubles. He told me about the "I Never Drink Coffee" line. If I could have been sure it wouldn't have imediately destroyed every bone in his face, I would have slapped him and called him a fool. 

>Instead, I said simply "Frank, how stupid are you?" 

---- 

Ruby's words hit me like a sack of bricks. I was still realing from the fairly powerful psychic barage she threw at me when I mentioned Minnie's name, and then she went and called me stupid. It was more than a guy should haveta take, and I told her as much. It didn't help that she was right. I didn't tell her that, but I didn't really have to. She knew I was being stupid as well as I did. 

"So, Minnie's been dead for four years?" I asked. 

"Well Yeah. She was undead for nearly 100 years before that, and then she was steaked through the heart by a disgruntled hunter on the way home from Sunday mass, four years ago today." Ruby replied with something like a sigh. It wasn't too much like a sigh, mind you. It was more like the screams of all of the souls in hell, but I've come to understand that it served the same purpose as your average human sigh. 

"So who the hell was I talking to?" I asked, knowing I wasn't going to like the answer. 

"From the way you described her, and the half daze you've been walking around in, I'd say you were talking to a succubus with powerful enemies, Frank. Look, you gotta be careful. Even I don't like to deal with Vampires." 

That surprised me. "Surely, you're not afraid of a few bloodsuckers" I asked. 

"Nah, nothin' like that. I just hate the way the talks, is all" 

Good ol' ruby. 

So I left the bar with more questions than I'd had when I went in, but I felt a lot better. The psychic torture Ruby was slinging was enough to help me shake off whatever lingering effects "Minnie" left with me. Well, that, and another bottle. 

I stumbled a few blocks down the road, and found myself standing in front of my building. I was not alone. There was a surprisingly large crowd of tall, thin, men wearing stylish black clothes. I was fairly drunk, and I do not remember exactly what happened next, but based on the evidence I was confronted with the next day, I imagine it went something like this: 

I walked in to the middle of the crowd, and said "Please, good sirs, could each of you punch me in the face as hard as you can?" 

Alternately, it's possible that I walked up to the largest of them and said "All vampires are leaches," before unloading my gun in to him. That would explain why it was empty, and also bent in half. 

Either way, I survived my encounter with the crowd of angry vampires. I was pretty badly beaten, I don't remember anything, and a perfectly good gun was ruined, but I survived.

I took a look at my newfound sobriety, injury, lack of a functional firearm, and complete dearth of knowledge as to the nature of my assailants or my employer, and decided that it was time to do some investigating. So, as you would expect, I fished a piece of chalk out of the nightstand, and quickly scribbled some illegible sigils on the wooden floor of my bedroom. 

The sigils were illegible for two reasons. 1) to say my penmanship leaves something to be desired implies that there is anything desirable about it whatsoever and, 2) the symbols were from an ancient language that no human had been able to read for at least 500 years. Thankfully, the demon hoard doesn't tend to mind a little messy handwriting. I bent over the sigils, lit a candle in the middle, and cracked an egg on my head. 

Sure, it felt ridiculous, but thems the rules.
