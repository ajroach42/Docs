## Normal Occult Investigations

### Minnie Harker

They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. I don't know much for men, but if you try to get to a vampire's heart through his stomach... well, that's going to end pretty poorly for you. The way to a vampire's heart is through his chest with a wooden stake, if you catch my meaning. By the time I was through, I'd found the hearts of five or six of them suckers, no stomachs required.  

The name's Normal. Frank Normal, Occult detective. I solve the crimes that the other detectives are too scared, too smart, or too boring to touch. Hell, I'll do just about anything for $29 a day plus expenses. I been in this buisness a lotta years, and with my reputation, and all the wackadoo witchcraft Washington attracts, you'd think I'd have it pretty swell. Thing is, you'd be wrong.

Besides, if I had things so swell, there'd be no story. And brother is there ever a story. This one starts, as most of the great ones do, with a dame.

---

It was a quarter to five on a cold evening in late January, there was half an inch of ice covering everything, and I could see the sun starting to set through the lone window of the barely-not-condemned office that I refered to optimistically as the world headquarters of Normal Occult Investigations. I hadn't seen a client, or more importantly, a fee, in two weeks. The only thing keeping the lights on was the fact that the roads were too trecherous for anyone to come by and cut the power. I'm not even really sure what I was doing in the office, other than throwing back enough dark roast to give me heartburn for two weeks and foolishly hoping that I'd find a miracle client. 

I didn't. Instead I found a dame. The dame knocked on the door, which was odd. Folks don't normally knock, but I didn't think much of it. It was icey out, and not many places were open. I was relieved enough to have someone at the door, I didn't give it much thought as I opened it. 

"Come in, come in Ms..." 

"Harker. Call me Minnie" she said in a voice that reaked of quiet authority. 

"Minnie it is then. Please, have a seat." I said, gesturing to a green leather sofa opposite my desk, and feeling for all the world like the most inaddiquit man that has ever lived. She was a looker, 5' 7", slim, pale, big red lips, dressed to the nines. 

She sat down, and looked at me expectantly. I realized I was staring. 

"Can I offer you some coffee Ms. Harker" 

"Call me Minnie" she repeted, and I felt like a dolt. 

"Minnie, then. Can I offer you some coffee Minnie?" 

"Oh, I never drink" she said, and paused for a beat too long before adding "Coffee, that is. I never drink Coffee." 

If I had been thinking straight, I would have sent her out the door right that second. Throwing me an old softball like that. Hell, it was practically Lugossi. A pale woman with a white parasol, dressed head to toe in black--Her name was Minnie Harker for chrissake--stood in my office, damn near quotes The Count himself, and I didn't notice. 

In my defense, she was beautiful, and I needed a client. 

"What can I do for you Minnie?" I asked, with an earnestness I'm seldom found wearing. 

"Well, Mr. Normal" she began "I'm afraid I'm in a bit of trouble, and I need some help. 

"What kind of trouble Minnie?" Again, I was so earnest. So eager. It almost makes me want to wretch. 

"I guess I better start at the beginning Mr. Normal." she said, launching in to her tale. I won't bore you with the steamy details, mostly because I'm embarassed that I believed them, but the end result was a contract stipulating that I would investigate her two brothers, Drake and Johnathan, and in return she would pay me $29 dollars a day, plus expenses. 

It seemed like a swell deal at the time. 

I stayed in the office for another few minutes after she left, sucking on a bottle of scotch and trying to shake the sense that I had just gotten myself in the middle of something bad. She'd been out the door five whole minutes before I pieced together she was a vampire, but by then it was already too late.

I stood up, poured the rest of the office scotch and the remains of the office coffee in to a mug, grabbed my coat, my beretta, and my hat, and made for the door. There was a storm blowing in, the sun had already set (and it wasn't even half past five), and I'd just agreed to tail two probable vampires for another probable vampire. I was in for a long night. 

The thing about being an Occult Detective is that you have a tendency to piss off, well, everyone. Over the years, I've brawled with more than any man's fair share of Werewolfs, Deathcults, Demons, Angels, and a rogue God or two. Hell, it's barely been a year since I was in a spitting match with ol' Lucifer himself. And, to be clear, that's not a game I want to play again any time soon, it would have almost been preferable to what came next. 

I don't normally dance with Vampires. In all my years as an Occult Investigator, I'd managed to stay, more or less, off their radar. That was by design. See, most vampires take the whole "brotherhood" thing pretty seriously. You piss one of them off, and next thing you know his six buddies have mesmerised you in to performing a political assassination and jumping off a bridge. 

I was not looking forward to this case. 

I took a swing from my mug, and left it on top of the filing cabinet by the door. As the burn subsided I made a mental note to pad my expense report a little more than normal, and stepped out the front door and in to the cold winter air. 

-------

>Hiya, folks around these parts call me Ruby. Folks 'round your parts would probably just call me "AHHH! LOOK! WHAT IS THAT THING!", or "BE GONE FOUL CREATURE OF THE NIGHT" but I'll try not to take it personally. I'm what you would call a creature of unspeakable terror. You know the type I mean, all tenticles and teeth. I run a little speakeasy that caters to occult types a few blocks from Frank's office. 

>Frank stops in most nights on his way home from the office. I've never understood that, because I know he pulls from his office bottle at least once an hour, but he never causes any trouble and he's helped me out a time or two, so I don't ask too many questions. When he came by that night, well, that night things was different. Frank kept alternating between lookin' like he was in a trance and lookin like he was terrified. I couldn't help but check in on him. 

>When he saw me, he screamed. This was pretty normal. I let him get it out of his system. Eventually, he stopped and said "Ruby, I think I'm in trouble" more sheepishly than I can ever remember him speaking. I slid over to the piano in the corner of the room and asked Howie to take over at the bar, then I told Frank to join me in the back where we could talk.

>It took a lot to shake up Frank, so when we had found a little bit of privacy, I decided to get some answers. 

>"What's goin on Frankie?" I said, trying to sound concerned. 

>"Ruby... I got a new client tonight" 

>"Well that's great news Frank, why do you look like someone shot your dog?" 

>"Ruby..." He said, his mouth hanging open like he was trying to force words through it. Eventually, he managed to continue "What do you know about Minnie Harker?" 

> The name hit me like a punch to the gut. Well, that's not fair, since a punch to the gut wouldn't be possible or effective against me, as I'm a massive creature of unimaginable horror. The name hit me like a punch to the gut would hit you, or another soft squishy human. My vision blurred. 

>"I feel like I hit a nerve, there" Frank said, with a wince. I must have been emmitting a low level field of emotional pain. It happens sometimes when I'm caught off guard. 

>"Frank, Minnie was a dear friend of mine. Her death was tragic, but there was nothing mysterious about it." 

>Frank winced again, but this time it was under his own power. He looked at me with disbelief in his eyes. With more disbelief in his eyes than is normally found in the eyes of someone staring at a barkeep of unimaginable ancient horror. 

>"Ruby, I think I better start at the beginning" Frank finally said. 

>He told me about seeing "The Dame". He told me about his money troubles. He told me about the "I Never Drink Coffee" line. If I could have been sure it wouldn't have imediately destroyed every bone in his face, I would have slapped him and called him a fool. 

>Instead, I said simply "Frank, how stupid are you?" 

---- 

Ruby's words hit me like a sack of bricks. I was still realing from the fairly powerful psychic barage she threw at me when I mentioned Minnie's name, and then she went and called me stupid. It was more than a guy should haveta take, and I told her as much. It didn't help that she was right. I didn't tell her that, but I didn't really have to. She knew I was being stupid as well as I did. 

"So, Minnie's been dead for four years?" I asked. 

"Well Yeah. She was undead for nearly 100 years before that, and then she was steaked through the heart by a disgruntled hunter on the way home from Sunday mass, four years ago today." Ruby replied with something like a sigh. It wasn't too much like a sigh, mind you. It was more like the screams of all of the souls in hell, but I've come to understand that it served the same purpose as your average human sigh. 

"So who the hell was I talking to?" I asked, knowing I wasn't going to like the answer. 

"From the way you described her, and the half daze you've been walking around in, I'd say you were talking to a succubus with powerful enemies, Frank. Look, you gotta be careful. Even I don't like to deal with Vampires." 

That surprised me. "Surely, you're not afraid of a few bloodsuckers" I asked. 

"Nah, nothin' like that. I just hate the way the talks, is all" 

Good ol' ruby. 

So I left the bar with more questions than I'd had when I went in, but I felt a lot better. The psychic torture Ruby was slinging was enough to help me shake off whatever lingering effects "Minnie" left with me. Well, that, and another bottle. 

I stumbled a few blocks down the road, and found myself standing in front of my building. I was not alone. There was a surprisingly large crowd of tall, thin, men wearing stylish black clothes. I was fairly drunk, and I do not remember exactly what happened next, but based on the evidence I was confronted with the next day, I imagine it went something like this: 

I walked in to the middle of the crowd, and said "Please, good sirs, could each of you punch me in the face as hard as you can?" 

Alternately, it's possible that I walked up to the largest of them and said "All vampires are leaches," before unloading my gun in to him. That would explain why it was empty, and also bent in half. 

Either way, I survived my encounter with the crowd of angry vampires. I was pretty badly beaten, I don't remember anything, and a perfectly good gun was ruined, but I survived.

I took a look at my newfound sobriety, injury, lack of a functional firearm, and complete dearth of knowledge as to the nature of my assailants or my employer, and decided that it was time to do some investigating. So, as you would expect, I fished a piece of chalk out of the nightstand, and quickly scribbled some illegible sigils in to a small octagon on the wooden floor of my bedroom. 

The sigils were illegible for two reasons. 1) to say my penmanship leaves something to be desired implies that there is anything desirable about it whatsoever and, 2) the symbols were from an ancient language that no human had been able to read for at least 500 years. Thankfully, the demon hoard doesn't tend to mind a little messy handwriting. I bent over the sigils, lit a candle in the middle, and cracked an egg on my head. 

Sure, it felt ridiculous, but thems the rules.

Half a moment passed. Long enough for me to wonder if I'd done everything right, but not long enough to try and change anything. Then there was a small pop, and in the center of the small octagon stood a tiny demon, in a bellhop's uniform.

"Jackson Q. Demon, my old pal" I said. 

"I hate it when you draw the octagon so small" he said, his voice shrill. 

"That's why I keep doing it" I responded. I'd really outdone myself this time, he was barely 8 inches tall. 

"And you wonder why no one else ever wants to help you." he tried to sound menacing, or at least angry, but it just came accross as comical. I tried to keep a straight face, but I laughed in spite of myself. 

"Look, Jackson, I'm in trouble and I need some help." 

That got his attention. I could see the tiny wheels turning inside his tiny head. He was already looking for an angle. You'll never meet a con-artist like a little demon. 

"Alright, alright" the little guy said "I'll help, but it's gonna cost you." 

"You don't even know what the trouble is yet" I told him. 

"The trouble is that you got beat up by a bunch of vampires, they broke your gun, and now you can't remember why." The little imp grinned, and I hated it. 

"How do you" I started. 

"Skip it" Jackson said. "You want my help or not?" 

"Yeah, I want your help." 

"That's what I thought. My rate is $12 a day, plus expenses." 

"You're rates gone up, Jack" I said, as I reached for my wallet. He made some inneffective quip about that being the way of things, but I didn't really hear him. There was a slip of paper in my wallet, that said: 

	Frank, it's Frank. If you're reading this, you summoned Jackson. 
    
    I hope you made him super tiny, that always makes me laugh. 
    Anyway, you summoned him last night, too. 
    
    He's already been paid. His rate was $10/day, and don't let him 
    tell you no different. You've got him on a two day retainer. 
    
    Make him tell you what he knows about the vamps. 
    
    It's what you knew, before things went screwy. 

"Gee, Jackson, looks like I already paid you. At $10/day, on a two day retainer. Now tell me what you know 'bout the vamps, and why I can't remember nothin." 

Jackson grinned "See, Frank, that's why I like you. Even when you're a step ahead 'a me, you're still two steps behind me."

*My name is Quetzitechnolichigan, but most meatbags call me Jackson. I'm a lesser demon, and a reporter for the Purgatory Gazette. When money's tight, I freelance as a fixer, an occult fence, and occasionally, an informant for the handful of humans that still know how to draw the squigles. I've been working with Frankie for years, but I've never seen him as messed up as he was that night.*

*He summoned me a little past 11 pm, right in the middle of the street. He was bleeding, and covered in the blood of several other creatures. His gun was half-way to being a pretzle. It was a mess. I started to crack wise, as you do in these situations, but before I could get my banter wound up he stops me, and real grim he says "I don't have much time. I'm drunk. I'm tired. I've been beaten half to death. And I just killed the King of the local vampire coven, along with his five favorite accolytes."*

*That shut me up real fast. I don't mess with Vampires. So I just stood there and listened. He kept talkin', real fast, and he got me up to speed. There was a dame, she was trouble, she lied about who she was, before he had a chance to figure out what was goin' on, the stiffs he was supposed to investigate jumped him in front of his apartment. He unloaded his gun in to the first one, which didn't do much. He turned a fruit stand in to a coupla wood steaks, and proceeded to go man-to-man with the strongest vampires in the city.* 

*Apparently, he was so drunk they couldn't mesmerize him. Apparently, the more he sobered up, the more their attempts to erase his memory started to work. Apparently, as they fought, he'd pieced together that the dame that had been to see him earlier that day really was Minnie. The frail everyone thought was Minnie was the real imposter, and the Hunter that did it all was Minnie's brother Drake.*

*How he figured all that out while shoving steaks through the hearts of vampires I'll never know. The man was good, but I'd never tell him that. Eventually, he stopped talking, and told me what he needed me to do.*

*"Jackson" he says "Jackson ol' buddy, I need you to help me get upstairs and in to bed. I need you to find me a new gun. And I need you to find my client, so I can get paid."*

*I told him that this was fine, and that I'd work for my usual fee: $5/day plus expenses. He slips me five dollars, and we head in to the building.* 

*A few minutes later, as we're walking up the stairs, he stops and looks at me real serious like.  "Jackson" he says "Jackson ol' buddy, I need you to help me get upstairs and in to bed. I need you to find me a new gun. And I need you to find my client, so I can get paid."* 

*I told him that this was fine, and that I'd work for my usual fee: $10/ day plus expenses, and I'd need two days in advance. The bloodsuckers musta done a real number on him, cause he agreed! Here I am with $25 in my pocket. My luck wasn't perfect though. He insisted on writing himself a note and leaving it in his wallet so he didn't pay me again the next day.* 

*I led him to his room, his facculties fading quickly in the face of his pending sobriety and the massive onslaught of magic the vampires had thrown at him. I left a rod in his coat pocket, with five or six fireball charges left on it. I'm not about to hand that man a weapon that can hurt me, but those fireballs will put a hole through most anyone else. Then, I set off to find his client.*

*It took me about half an hour to track her down. She was staying at a hotel uptown. I told her who I was, and explained that Frank had sent me. She paid in full, plus extra for his physical discomfort, right there on the spot. $70 total, more money than I'd held in a long time. Then she assured me that the vampires wouldn't come looking for him again.* 

*So the next morning roles around, and he summons me again. I nearly managed to talk him out of another fee, but he found his note before he found any cash. It's all for the best, anyway, seeing as I already had the dough from his client. I figured I'd tell him about that, one day, but I wasn't planning on making it today. *

*I fill him in on a few of the details. I tell him about the fight, and about summoning me. I tell him that there was an obvious conspiracy, what with Minnie being dead and his client being an imposter, and that I'm sure he'll be able to work all the details out for himself once his head clears. At that, he winces. I leave out the first $5 he paid me, and conviently forget to mention that I'd run in to his client. I tell him about the rod in his pocket, and that it should only take me another day or two to find the girl.*

*"I'd do it myself" he starts.*

*"Frank, my boy, you're in no shape to leave this apartment. I insist that you stay here. I'll track her down, and get you your money. It'll take two days, three tops."* 

*"Jackson, if I didn't feel so bad, I'd come over there and punch you."*

*"There's a reason I gave you a rod, a not a gun, Frank." I said with a grin. "Now you just lay back and let old Jackson Q. Demon take care of the rest. It shouldn't take me more than three days, four at the outside." *

*"Jackson, I'm serious. Stop jerking me around. If I can't find Minnie before she skips town, or before the other vampires come after me..."* 

*"Frank, buddy, It's me Quetzitechnolichigan. Have I ever steered you wrong?"* 

*"Jackson, if you don't find the girl soon, I'm going to leave you that size forever." Frank said with a vindictive look in his eye.* 

*"Fine, fine. I heard she was staying in a hotel up the way, I'll go find her, just return me to normal size first, okay?"* 

*Frank made good, and I left. I swung by Ruby's for a drink. Frank wouldn't like it, but he was in no position to complain. Ruby always makes for good conversation, even if being in physical proximity to her does put my teeth on edge. I stayed for a few drinks, and let Frank sweat for a couple hours. Eventually, I made my way back to his place.* 

*"Frank, I found her room, but she was gone." I said, with a hint of remorse in my voice. "She left an envelope with your name on it. Inside was $25, and a note that said 'They's coming, be careful'." I handed him the $25, trying to keep a straight face.* 

*Now, what happened next absolutely warms my little demon heart. Frankie looks me square in the eye, pulls a gun out from under his pillow, and says "I want the rest of the money you little creep."* 

*I disapeared outa there in a flash, but I left behind another $40. If he ever asks about the last five, I'll tell him the rest was "expenses" 's what he woulda done. I gotta hand it to ol' square jaw, I'm still not sure how he knew I was pulling one over on him.*

-----

When Jackson left me that morning, I was wrattled. I haven't seen that much combat in a long time. I couldn't remember a thing after I saw the vampires, and I had this sneaking suscpicion the punk was pulling one over on me. 

I called Ruby, and told her to keep an eye out, and that if Jackson came by she should keep him there as long as she could. Ever the loyal friend, she did just that. I figured Jackson would be gone for at least  two or three hours, so I went and visited Minnie myself. 

She was as beautiful as I remembered, and she was definitely a vampire. I told her that I couldn't remember anything, and she filled in the gaps. She even unpretzled my gun, although I have no confidence that it would fire. When she finally explained everything, I smiled. I thanked her for her time, and I rushed back to my place so that I could shoot that no good demon Jackson in the face.

He didn't give me the satisfaction, and he left me with almost all the money. I'm sure when I finally hunt him down again, he'll shout something about expenses, and think he's very clever. 

At any rate, the power will stay on, and the doors will stay open at the world headquarters of Normal Occult Investigations, at least until next time.
