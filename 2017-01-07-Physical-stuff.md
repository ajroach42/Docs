Up to this point, we've mostly dealt with making Digital stuff. Eventually, you'll want to make some Physical goods out of your digital stuff. Here are guides for doing just that, along with some suggested hardware, and some tricks to keep your prices low. In each case, we'll highlight DIY and Third Party methods, including a breakdown of the differences in cost and quality.

## Gear 
To start things off, let's run down some gear you might want. 

**Laser Printer**
I recommend getting a cheap Brother laser printer for doing flyers, zines, and anything else you can get away with printing in black and white. Specifically, I recommend getting a Brother printer for two reasons. 1) You can get toner refills pretty cheaply online, so you can reuse the same toner cartridge 5-10 times, which brings your cost per page down to something like 1/10th of a cent. 2) The printers themselves are dirt cheap (often less than $100) and they last forever. 

I've used my brother hl-2270dw to produce thousands of magazines, and it's still kicking. 

**Color Printer** 
Don't get anything fancy, you're going to wear this thing in to the ground. The key features to look out for are: Direct-to-disk CD Printing 



## CDs (and DVDs and Bluray Discs)

**CDs**
It's possible to make high quality professional looking CDs at home. You just need a couple of things. 1) a computer with a CD Burner. 2) a printer that will print CDs. 3) a method of packaging CDs

To take care of 1, use whatever you have handy. I tend to build my initial CD in iTunes from WAV or FLAC files, and burn a master copy with CD-Text enabled. Then I'll rip an image with IMGBURN, and make duplicates from there (often on three or four laptops at the same time.) For part 2, I recommend the Cannon Pixma ip7220. It can print directly on to [printable top blank CDs](https://www.amazon.com/Smartbuy-Inkjet-Printable-Recordable-100-Disc/dp/B00KD11JW4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483846420&sr=8-1&keywords=printable+top+CDs), and can use cheap, remanufactured ink cartridges. For 3, I have what I consider a pretty clever solution: use [clear plastic CD sleeves](https://www.amazon.com/Maxtek-Transparent-Plastic-Envelope-thickness/dp/B00S05R5QY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483846472&sr=8-1&keywords=plastic+CD+sleeves), with folded 5x5 cardstock inserts. Print the inserts on 8.5x11 cardstock, trim them to 5x5 and fold them in half. 

The end result is a little different than a traditional CD package, but it's super cheap and looks slick. 

**DVDs and Blurays**
Parts 2 and 3 for DVDs work the same way as they do for CDs, you just use blank Printable Top DVDs instead. They're a little more expensive, but that's about the only diference from the production standpoint. Package them like you would package CDs. It'll save time and money. 

Creating the initial disc is a little more complicated, but not much. On Windows, I recommend DVDStyler. It's free, and not super hard to use. Use this to make an ISO file, and then use [IMGBurn](http://www.imgburn.com/) to burn that ISO file to your DVDs. 

If you have a Bluray burner, and you can find printable top Bluray discs, you can do the same thing for regular blurays. On the other hand, if you're like most people, you'll be better off making AVCHD DVDs instead. Again, if you're like most people, you don't know what an AVCHD DVD is, I'll explain. 

**AVCHD DVD** 
AVCHD DVDs are neat! They are (generally) 720p movies, burned on to (generally) duel-layer DVDs. They can be played back in any standard bluray player. This way you can make blurays, or something like it, on the cheap. Use [MultiAVCHD](http://multiavchd.deanbg.com/tutorial.php#download) to create your images, and [IMGBurn](http://www.imgburn.com/) to burn them.  

## Cassettes

**DIY**
Step 1: Make a Master tape 

Playlist + Auxcable + Boombox 

Step 2: Copies! 

You can do these one at a time with any dual cassette decks. You can do many at a time with a Cassette duplicator. You can pick those up second hand for around $100. 

Step 3: Packaging! 

Print your J-Cards on 4x6 photo paper, and trim the to size. [This template can help.](https://www.duplication.ca/printspecs/k7insertspecs.htm) I like the [soft poly boxes.](https://www.deltamedia.com/1CSPB1.html?leftmenu=mediasuppliesnav&id=hoALnMSq)

Labels are also nice. Dymo makes some, that aren't too expensive.
