Up to this point, we've mostly dealt with making Digital stuff. Eventually, you'll want to make some Physical goods out of your digital stuff. Here are guides for doing just that, along with some suggested hardware, and some tricks to keep your prices low. In each case, we'll highlight DIY and Third Party methods, including a breakdown of the differences in cost and quality.

## Gear 

To start things off, let's run down some gear you might want. 

**Laser Printer**

I recommend getting a cheap Brother laser printer for doing flyers, zines, and anything else you can get away with printing in black and white. Specifically, I recommend getting a Brother printer for two reasons. 1) You can get toner refills pretty cheaply online, so you can reuse the same toner cartridge 5-10 times, which brings your cost per page down to something like 1/10th of a cent. 2) The printers themselves are dirt cheap (often less than $100) and they last forever. 

I've used my brother hl-2270dw to produce thousands of magazines, and it's still kicking. 

**Color Printer** 

Don't get anything fancy, you're going to wear this thing in to the ground. The key features to look out for are: Direct-to-disk CD Printing, availability of cheap/third-party ink, and max paper size. I've used models from Cannon and Epson, and I've burned through 3 printers, while making hundreds of photo prints, comic books, magazines, and more than 5000 CDs. 

**Paper Trimmer** 

You need a paper trimmer. It doesn't have to be fancy, it does have to functional. There are dozens of 12 x 12 paper trimmers out there. If you can get a larger one, do. If you can't, don't worry about it too much. You'll use this for trimming CD cases, cassette J-Cards, posters, and books. 

**Long Arm Stapler**

The model doesn't matter, but you'll need one of these for binding zines, books, and comics. 

**Heavy Duty Stapler**

Mostly useful for bookbinding, and for the "tape-binding" magazine method. Get a stapler that can staple through at least 30 pages. 

## CDs (and DVDs and Bluray Discs)

**CDs**

It's possible to make high quality professional looking CDs at home. You just need a couple of things. 1) a computer with a CD Burner. 2) a printer that will print CDs. 3) a method of packaging CDs

To take care of 1, use whatever you have handy. I tend to build my initial CD in iTunes from WAV or FLAC files, and burn a master copy with CD-Text enabled. Then I'll rip an image with IMGBURN, and make duplicates from there (often on three or four laptops at the same time.) 

For part 2, I recommend any printer that can print directly do CDs, such as the Cannon Pixma ip7220 or the Epson Artisan 1430. They can print directly on to [printable top blank CDs](https://www.amazon.com/Smartbuy-Inkjet-Printable-Recordable-100-Disc/dp/B00KD11JW4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483846420&sr=8-1&keywords=printable+top+CDs), and can use cheap, remanufactured ink cartridges. 

For 3, I have what I consider a pretty clever solution: use [clear plastic CD sleeves](https://www.amazon.com/Maxtek-Transparent-Plastic-Envelope-thickness/dp/B00S05R5QY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483846472&sr=8-1&keywords=plastic+CD+sleeves), with folded 5x5 cardstock inserts. Print the inserts on 8.5x11 cardstock, trim them to 5x5 and fold them in half. 

The end result is a little different than a traditional CD package, but it's super cheap and looks slick. 

**DVDs and Blurays**

Parts 2 and 3 for DVDs work the same way as they do for CDs, you just use blank Printable Top DVDs instead. They're a little more expensive, but that's about the only diference from the production standpoint. If you package them like you would package CDs it'll save time and money. Alternately, if you have a large format printer, you can buy empty DVD packages, and print labels using your large format printer. (A standard 8.5x11 printer cannot print DVD sleeves.)  

Creating the initial disc is a little more complicated, but not much. On Windows, I recommend DVDStyler. It's free, and not super hard to use. Use this to make an ISO file, and then use [IMGBurn](http://www.imgburn.com/) to burn that ISO file to your DVDs. 

If you have a Bluray burner, and you can find printable top Bluray discs, you can do the same thing for regular blurays. On the other hand, if you're like most people, you'll be better off making AVCHD DVDs instead. Again, if you're like most people, you don't know what an AVCHD DVD is, I'll explain. 

**AVCHD DVD** 

AVCHD DVDs are neat! They are (generally) 720p movies, burned on to (generally) duel-layer DVDs. They can be played back in any standard bluray player. This way you can make blurays, or something like it, on the cheap. Use [MultiAVCHD](http://multiavchd.deanbg.com/tutorial.php#download) to create your images, and [IMGBurn](http://www.imgburn.com/) to burn them.  

You can print sleeves for empty bluray cases using a standard 8.5x11 printer, or you can package them as you would CDs above. I'm a fan of consistency, so I tend to do everything using the CD method. Consumers are also fans of consistency, so DVD/Bluray packaging can serve as a strong signal of a more high quality product. It all depends on your audience. 

## Cassettes

**DIY**

Step 1: Make a Master tape 

Making a tape is super easy, if you have a tape player with a Line in. Just run any audio source (CD, playlist, etc) in to the line in, and record on to a blank tape (or on to a not-blank tape, with the not blank holes on the top covered.) Be sure to leave enough of a gap in your audio that you can flip the tape over when you reach the end of side one. 

Essentially, it's just: Playlist + Auxcable + Boombox 

Step 2: Copies! 

You can do these one at a time with any dual cassette decks. You can do many at a time with a Cassette duplicator. You can pick those up second hand for around $100. Tapes recorded using a regular cassette deck, in real time, will sound better. Cheap duplicators tend to work in Mono only, and can compromise sound quality. 

Step 3: Packaging! 

Print your J-Cards on 4x6 photo paper, and trim the to size. [This template can help.](https://www.duplication.ca/printspecs/k7insertspecs.htm) I like the [soft poly boxes.](https://www.deltamedia.com/1CSPB1.html?leftmenu=mediasuppliesnav&id=hoALnMSq)

Labels are also nice. [Here are some, that aren't too expensive.](https://www.amazon.com/Compulabel-311905-Audio-Cassette-Labels/dp/B000U5M4CW/ref=sr_1_1?s=office-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1483991866&sr=1-1&keywords=cassette+label)

Something to consider: you may want to include a digital download of the album with the tape. In my experience, this really helps drive cassette sales over other mediums. 

**Third Party**

[These guys have fairly cheap duplication rates](http://nationalaudiocompany.com/Cassette-Duplication-C14001181.aspx) if you're making more than 100 copies. They're friendly, and do good work. 


## Books/magazines/comics

*Preping your files* 

The easiest way to prep your files is in MS-Word. Set Word up for 5.5x8.5 pages, with at least .25" margins. Add page numbers in the footer, paste in your document, and save, then export to PDF. You can use this file with our DIY binding methods, or with a third party printer. 

**DIY**

DIY Bookmaking is steeped in tradition dating back to the dawn of recorded history. There are a few simple ways to go about it. Here are some simple techniques that will start you down the right path. 

*Zine Style*

Use your Laser Printer and long arm stapler (see above) to print and bind your file. When printing, select "booklet style" from the options menu. You won't get a spine, it'll look cheap, and it can cost you less than $.10 per copy. If you absolutely need color, you can do that with your inkjet printer, but it does slow the proccess down and cost more. I only really recommend it for comic books, and for covers for traditional books, everything else is fine in Black and White. 

This method works best for books/magazines/comics of 40 pages or less. If you need more pages than that, and you want to use the traditional zine method, replace the staples with stitching like so: 1) using an awl, drill, or nail, make four holes through your stack of paper. 2) stitch your spine together. This will result in something that looks entirely unlike a traditional book, but it serves it's purpose in many cases. 

*Semi-Traditional Binding* 

If your zine/book/comic is more than 40 pages (or so) the Zine binding with a long arm stapler won't work anymore. In this instances, you have a couple of DIY options, but what I've found that works best is a play on traditional bookbinding. Many books from the 50s and 60s were made using methods very similar to this. 

1) Print everything out, booklet style, same as before. 

2) Take 15 - 20 sheets at a time, and cut them in half with your paper trimmer

3) Stack those up, and continue until everything is trimmed

4) If this stack is smaller than the max size of your heavy duty stapler, staple it. If not, half it, and staple the halves. 

4a) if you had to half it, press the two halves together and brush on some regular white glue 

5) measure the spine of your book, design your cover file to accomodate the spine width, and print on high quality cardstock  

6) hot-glue the cover to the spine, pressing the spine and sides of the book firmly. Some hotglue will leak around the top and bottom of the book, as well as getting in between your cover and the first and last pages. This is normal, and good. If this doesn't happen, you didn't use enough glue. 

7) In many cases, it is desirable to add a coat of modgepodge or another clear finish, to make the finished product more sturdy. 

This method can be used to cheaply and (somewhat) quickly make single copies of books. They will have a definite handmade feel, but will be sturdy enough to stand up to being carried around in a back pocket for weeks (speaking from experience.)



**3rd Party**

Print on Demand book manufacturing is not terribly expensive today. There are several options, including: Amazon CreateSpace, Barnes and Noble NookPress, and Lulu. Each of these companies allows you to print single or multiple copies of books, and have them shipped to you, or directly to your customers. This is the cheapest way to get a book that feels professional, through and through. It is more expensive, and takes longer, than going the hand-made route, but it can save considerable effort, and the end results look very nice. 

## Clothes

**DIY**

*Screen Printing!* 

Screen printing isn't super hard, but it does require access to some chemicles you wouldn't normally have around, and the DIY method can really only produce single color designs. That said, a screen printed shirt looks good, and the design will last as long as any traditional manufacturing method. In bulk, costs can be as low as $0.50 + cotton/shirt. 

Here is [a step by step guide to screenprinting at home](http://lifehacker.com/5886483/simple-guide-to-screen-printing-your-own-shirts). 

*Iron ons!* 

Heat transfers, or iron-ons are another way to put your designs on t-shirts, handbags, and even canvas shoes. It takes a little practice to get the method right (essentially, more heat, more pressure, and more time. When you think you're done, double it) but the end results can be very nice, and in full color.

There are a few worries with heat transfers: 

1. Cost - Heat transfers cost more per item than screen printing (though less than working with a third part) 
1. Colors - Heat transfers can be used to produce full color designs, but your printer probably doesn't have white ink. That means that anywhere that should be white in your image will actually be transparent (and any color that should be tinted with white will be tinted against your fabric color.) Not a problem if you're printing on white, or if you compensate in your print file 
1. Dark Fabrics - Ironing on to darker fabrics requires using a more complicated iron on, that is essentially a latex sheet that you'll trim to size and adhear to your fabric. This gives you the ability to use white, but it can be less comfortable to wear, and takes practice to get right. 
1. Longevity - heat transfers fade over time. I have iron-on shirts that are several years old, and while the images are still present, they do not look as nice as my screen-printed shirts from the same time frame. 

**Third Party**

The Printful is the best 3rd party clothing manufacturer that I know of. They will dropship single items, and their prices (though significantly higher than DIY) are not unreasonable. I've ordered from them on many occasions, and found them to be great to work with, helpful, and responsive. 

They print directly to the shirt, the end results look wonderful, and they last as long as traditional manufacturing methods. 

Seriosuly, check them out. 

## 3D Printing

**DIY**

If you want to make physical goods with a 3D printer, you'll need a 3D Printer. The monoprice Select Mini 3D printer is $200, and works well. 

You'll also need to design 3D objects. I wish I could be more help with that, but it's still pretty difficult. Your best option is often to turn to one of the many public repositories of 3D printable objects. 

**Third Party**

3D hubs will match you with local folks who will print your items for you. Their rates are generally fairly low (though higher than taking the DIY route) and they quality of work tends to be excellent. 


## Posters

**DIY**

There are a bunch of ways to make posters. Some of the most popular: 

Screenprinting - Works just like screen-printing on to cotton. Great if you want to do a limited run of high quality images in one or two colors. 

Large-Format Inkjets - Works just like printing anything else at home. Great if you already have the printer, and have a realiable source for cheap inks and paper. 


**Third Party**

Staples and Office Depot offer poster sized draft prints in black and white for ~$2, and color for ~$4. These are not super high quality prints, but they are cheap, huge, and they get the job done. They'll also do 11 x 17 color laser prints for ~$2. These look wonderful. Since there is a staples or an office depot in nearly every town, this is a great way to resupply when you're on tour.
