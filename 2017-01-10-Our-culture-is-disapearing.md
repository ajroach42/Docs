Do you know how many episodes of Doctor Who have been lost, and will never be seen again? [97](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes), as of last count. What about shows that didn't go on to inspire global cult followings? Shows like Space Patrol, which broadcast over 900 episodes of which, less than 150 survive. The problem gets even worse if you [look at early film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lost_films) either missing or [incomplete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_incomplete_or_partially_lost_films). 

>  Martin Scorsese's Film Foundation claims that "half of all American films made before 1950 and over 90% of films made before 1929 are lost forever." Deutsche Kinemathek estimates that 80â€“90% of silent films are gone; the film archive's own list contains over 3500 lost films. A study by the Library of Congress states that 75% of all silent films are now lost.

Beyond TV and radio, other commercial media suffers largely the same fate: radio programs, art, songs, books, and software have been lost to time, to decay, or to ineptitude, to say nothing of the [art we've lost to outright malice](https://medium.com/@peterbcampbell/why-hitler-stole-art-2136f1f54e77#.l87sevt6k). 

Copyright plays a pretty large role in this, too. There are hundreds (thousands) of works of fiction, accross most mediums, that are not available commercially. While these works can't be considered "lost" as copies of them still exist, somewhere, but that doesn't mean you'll ever find one. This problem is especially insidious in situations in which the rightful copyright holder cannot be discerned. No one is willing to undertake the financial burden of an act of preservation and re-distribution when the threat of potential legal action still looms in the air. 

**This means that, while many works of the 20th century aren't currently considered lost, by the time we are legally able to preserve them, it will be too late.**

Add to that amature media, the DIY works that have existed for as long as media has existed, and you start to paint a pretty grim picture. Remember that CD or Cassette you used to have, of that local band from your home town? How many of those existed? 100? Less? Will yours even play anymore? (Some of mine won't, and I'll probably never be able to replace them.) The digital revolution enabled people to make their own media in ways never before possible, but we haven't developed the infrastructure required for long term archival and preservation. (Not to mention, our [terrible track record with curration and content discovery](http://ajroach42.github.io/how-to-fix-new-content-discovery/).) 

### Put simply, we're pretty shitty stewards of culture.

The [internet archive](http://archive.org) does a reasonable job of fighting against this decay, but they're a single organization with limited resources, and only capable of preserving what the law allows (which is to say, a whole lot less than is ideal, but already more than their resources can manage. 

### There are also commercial enterprises that endevour to preserve our cultural heritage:

-[Dust to Digital](http://www.dust-digital.com/), for example, has done some excellent work in preserving the rapidly disapearing history of early recorded sound. 
-The critereon collection, and Kino international do good work in restoring classic pieces of cinema (and charging a premium for them.) Kino, specifically, has recently released this collection of [Early African American film](https://www.kinolorber.com/film/view/id/2124), which is sorely needed, and demonstrative of how pervasive the problem really is. 
-[Singularity and Co. Bookstore](http://singularityshop.com/collections/all-of-our-ebook-subscriptions) in NY regularly negotiates the digitization and re-release of still copyrighted, but unavailable science-fiction novels. 

But a lot of this comes in as (much) too little, and (far) too late. Laws like the DMCA criminalize breaking digital locks, even if the thing you would do after breaking the digital lock is completely legal. This means you can't even archive your own DVDs without violating this law. Without active legal reform, much of our culture will remain inaccessible for years to come.
